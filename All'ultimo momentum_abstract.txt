CUP FINAL MODEL

Neural Network
Nesterov Optimizer with scheduled momentum & learning rate 0.005.
layer structure: [in, 32, 64, 43, out], hidden function: sigmoid, output function: linear
L2 regularization with lambda factor 0.001. Max Epochs: 512, Batch Size: 64.
Initiaization method: he (mean=0, std=sqrt(2/n_nodes)). Early stopping with patience=10

VALIDATION TECHNIQUE
1. Split Train / HoldoutTest 80/20%. 
2. KFold CV(80%/20%) with K=5 and repeats=3 on Train Set. 
3. Retrain final model with early stopping and patience=10.
4. Assesment on Holdout Test Set.
